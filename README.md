# causal-maps
This is a collection of experiments in causality and representation learning.
In reality-model2/model2/ we created a custom [learning algorithm](https://github.com/Aranguri/causal-map/blob/master/reality-model2/model2/abegama.py) for neural networks. The learning algorithm used coefficients that were in turn learned by [evolution](https://github.com/Aranguri/causal-map/blob/master/reality-model2/model2/evolution.py). Then, the rest of the program in reality-model2/model2/ implements an environment where the agent's goal is to get food (reward) which is in a specific part of the world where it lives. (We created [visualizations](https://github.com/Aranguri/causal-map/blob/master/reality-model2/model2/drawer.py) to understand how the neural network was being trained and how the agent behaved.)
